Hong Kong Old Style (HKOS) (also known as Chinese Old Style or Cantonese) features a simple scoring system, which makes it popular for beginners and veterans alike. There are relatively few scoring elements, so players do not need to memorize many patterns. Also, each hand can be worth only certain amounts of points, so it is very easy to calculate scores.

Gameplay
The following gameplay sections differ or further clarify rules from the beginner's guide.

During the game a player may call to complete any one of the following sets:

Sheung: Claimed from the player to your left or for mahjong.
Pung: Claimed from any player. This must be declared before a player has a chance to call sheung. If a player fails to call for a tile, he cannot claim any identical tiles discarded until his next draw.
Gong: Claimed from any player. A replacement tile is drawn afterward.
Concealed and Small Melded Kong: Announced only after drawing a tile (i.e. not after claiming a tile). A replacement tile is drawn afterward.
Flower (optional): Announced immediately. A replacement tile is drawn afterward.
Arrangement of Tiles
Discards
Discards are placed randomly on the floor in no specific order. It is up to the player to try and discern what tiles his opponents need.

Sets
Concealed gongs have all tiles exposed (face up).

Post Hand
If the hand is a draw, the dealer deals again and all players retain their seat winds for the next hand. If the dealer wins the hand, he deals again and all players retain their seat winds for the next hand. If a non-dealer player wins, then the player to the right of the dealer becomes the new dealer and takes the east seat wind. The players change seat winds accordingly.

Post Round
After the round is over the prevalent wind changes. The order of the winds are East, South, West, North.

Post Game
The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

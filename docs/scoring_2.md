This is not a guide for how to play HK mahjong, just a scoring guide. To score a hand, add up the number of “fan” from the list of hands below, then refer to the table on the right. Each fan doubles the points up until 4 fan, then after that every 2 fan doubles the points. The maximum points is often set to 10 fan (128 points), but some rules allow going up to 13 (384 points).

When winning by self draw, all players pay your hands value. When winning by a player’s discard, the player who discarded that tile pays 2x your hand’s value, and the other players don’t pay anything.

Example: When winning a 4 fan hand by self draw, all other players pay 16 points.
Example: When winning a 7 fan hand by discard, only the discarding player pays 96 points (2x the hand value of 48).

It is common to set a requirement of 3 fan to win a hand, but it is recommended to not use this requirement when playing with beginners.

Notes:
This point system is using a rule called 全铳制 (discarder pays all) which increases the penalty for discarding another player’s winning tile. An alternative method is self-draw is 2x points from everyone, win by discard is 2x points from the discarder and 1x points from the other 2 players.
In the list of hands below, cells that are shaded green correspond to hands that are the most important to remember.
